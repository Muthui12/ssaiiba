                Account Setup / Email on file
                
                We will setup your account immediately after we have received payment. It is your responsibility to provide us with an email address which is not @ the domain(s) you are signing up under. If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, the primary email address on file will be used for this purpose. It is your responsibility to ensure the email address on file is current or up to date at all times. If you have a domain name registered with SSAIIBBA, it is your responsibility to ensure that the contact information for your domain account and your actual domain name(s) is correct and up-to-date. If you need to verify or change this information, you should contact our support team via email. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account.
                
                Ownership
                The e-mail address which is utilized for creating an account is designated as the authorized owner /account holder of the account. Thus all communication is channeled to this email and it is only through this email that we can receive instructions to make changes on the account.
                
                Transfers
                We will make every effort to help you move your site. However, transfers are provided as a courtesy service, and we cannot make guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult if not impossible to migrate some or all account data. We will try our best, but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host.
